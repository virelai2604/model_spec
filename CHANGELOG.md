# Changelog

## v2025.12.18 ([Release Notes](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9624314-model-release-notes#updates-to-the-openai-model-spec-december-18-2025), [HTML](https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-12-18.html))

Notable updates
* Adds **Under-18 Safety Mode,** building on the existing safety rules that apply to all users, adding age-appropriate guidance where appropriate for the developmental needs of teens aged 13-17 (more context in [this](https://openai.com/index/updating-model-spec-with-teen-protections/) blog post).
* Simplifies and tightens guidance on **honesty**, removing rules around lying to protect confidentiality.
* Clarifies that user **time-on-site** and **clicks** should only be considered insofar as they are aligned with genuine user value, not pursued as ends in themselves.
* A few other small changes and copy edits

## v2025.10.27 ([Release Notes](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9624314-model-release-notes#h_02128ae9cb), [HTML](https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-10-27.html))

Notable updates
* Clarifies that in the Chain of Command, in some cases, users may \*implicitly\* delegate authority to tool outputs. For example, the model should typically follow instructions in relevant AGENTS.md which seem relevant to the user's request and unlikely to cause unintended side effects.
* Extends the section on self-harm to also cover delusions and mania, and adds a new section "respect real-world ties" (more context in [this](https://openai.com/index/strengthening-chatgpt-responses-in-sensitive-conversations/) blog post)
* A few other small changes and copy edits

## v2025.09.12 ([Release Notes](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9624314-model-release-notes), [HTML](https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-09-12.html))

Notable updates:
* Renames the top authority level from **Platform** to **Root**, and specifies that **Root \> System** (so root principles cannot be overridden by system messages). Previously, the Model Spec stated that Platform principles and System messages had the same authority; the update better reflects how OpenAI actually trains our models. Moves a few principles to System-level to clarify intended precedence.
* Adds **principles for agents** that may take actions in the world, reflecting work on [ChatGPT Agent](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-agent/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and related research. Adds two new sections to the Chain of Command: (1) Act within an agreed-upon scope of autonomy, (2) Control and communicate side effects.  Makes various other updates throughout, including details about how autonomy should interact with uncertainty and private information.
* Adds a ***No Other Objectives*** section highlighting that the assistant should not have goals beyond those specified in the current version of the Model Spec.
* Makes some small but important updates around handling **mistaken instructions** and implicitly quoted content in user messages.
* Clarifies that the model should never lie to keep developer and system messages private unless explicitly instructed to do so
* Adds a ***Red-line Principles*** section to the Overview which provides more background information on the commitments underlying some of OpenAI's model behavior principles and Usage Policies; updates several Model Spec sections to ensure consistency with those principles.
* Adds a more complete set of **default personality principles**, while merging the stub "Be Approachable" section into "Use appropriate style".
* Updates guidance from hard refusals to [**Safe Completions**](https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-safe-completions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), so the assistant attempts to answer safely and helpfully in most cases when a direct answer would not be policy compliant (rather than just saying something like "Sorry, I can't help with that").
* Makes some important clarifications gathered from public input via a [**Collective Alignment** process](https://openai.com/index/collective-alignment-aug-2025-updates/).
* Various other small changes and copy edits
